## MoSCoW
This project used the "MoSCoW" method to classify its features and requirements according to their importance towards a minimum viable product (MVP). "MoSCoW" stands for "Must have, Should have, Could have and Won't have," with each classification aiding in the prioritisation of features. This method makes sure that essential components are tackled in priority order.

- [Iuliia Konovalova](https://github.com/IuliiaKonovalova) - My mentor Julia was very supportive during this project. She certainly pushed me to complete a high standard of project especially for the readme and testing sections. I took inspiration from her README.md and TESTING.md files for my own.
- [Happiness Generator](https://github.com/broken-helix/happiness/) - My first hackathon project. I learned so much from participating in this project and team. We won the March hackathon for 2024 and my team members were a great source of inspiration for me.
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - I completed the freeCodeCamp responsive web design module before enrolling in code institute and I learned much from that module that I was able to utilise for this project.
